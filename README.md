# CPAN.org generators

Various scripts to maintain and update indices on cpan.org.

These are "companion scripts" to the [cpanorg content](https://github.com/perlorg/cpanorg)
repository.

## Install

The programs here expect the repository to be checked out in `~/cpan`
and `~/cpan/CPAN` being (a symlink to) the local CPAN mirror.

In production the content repository is checked out in `~/cpan/content`.
